# cleftris
a tetris demake in PICO-8

a little unfinished, put on the backburner for now to focus on other projects :)
will probably come back to it later

## CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY
* draw grid
* grid can contain pieces
* pieces fall
* can control pieces as they fall, moving them left, right, or accelerate their fall speed
* can rotate pieces as they fall
* pieces collide with the bottom of the grid and get placed
* can change draw palette at will to predefined palettes

## FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY!
* you know, tetris stuff
* HIGH PRIORITY: line clearing when you fill a whole line of cells
* better (more intuitive) piece rotation
* score / piece fall speed increasing as you clear more lines
* palette changing as score increases
* sound effects!
* tetris theme remix as music, gets more frantic as the score increases?
